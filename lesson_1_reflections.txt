How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

 	It enabled me to quickly compare just the parts of the code that were different

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I could see the evolution of the history to learn how we solved issues and to also go back 
    and look at older code to help troubleshoot bugs in a new edition

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Having to manually create a commit enables one to save at logical intervals (which are subjective) rather than automated guesses

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Mulitple files are needed to run that piece of code together (like HTML and CSS)

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log enables me to see the history of all commits and git diff allows me to compare the versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It will allow me to know that if the changes have bugs I can easily revert to a stable code

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Keeping frequent commits with my code
